      <!-- INTRO -->
      <article class="story-section" id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The digital divide refers to unequal access to information and communication technologies worldwide. 
        This map compares internet penetration and mobile network infrastructure between two countries with 
        contrasting digital access.</p>

      <!-- GLOBAL PATTERNS -->
      <article class="story-section" id="global-patterns">
        <h2>Global Patterns of Digital Connectivity</h2>
        <p>When we explore the global map, a clear spatial pattern emerges. High-income regions in Europe, North America, 
        and East Asia form the "digitally saturated world", with near-universal broadband and mobile coverage.</p>

        <p>In contrast, much of Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia face structural barriers: limited 3G/4G rollout, 
        high mobile data costs, and inconsistent electricity access. These conditions create a strong digital 
        opportunity gap, where geography and infrastructure determine who can meaningfully participate online.</p>

        <p>Switch between the layers above to see how coverage does not automatically translate into usage.</p>

      <!-- NETHERLANDS -->
      <article class="story-section" id="netherlands">
        <h2>Netherlands – High Internet Access</h2>
        <p>The Netherlands boasts near-universal internet coverage, supported by dense 4G and 5G infrastructure and highly 
        affordable broadband. This reduces the urban–rural divide and enables widespread engagement in digital services, 
        from e-government to mobile banking.</p>
        <button onclick="zoomHigh()">Zoom to Netherlands</button>
        <div class="context-layer">
          <p>This region exemplifies a digitally inclusive society where infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy 
          converge to support near-total adoption.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <!-- CHAD -->
      <article class="story-section" id="chad">
        <h2>Chad – Limited Internet Access</h2>
        <p>Chad shows a starkly different situation. Despite around 60% of the population living in areas with 3G or 4G 
        availability, only about 13% actually use the internet. This demonstrates how infrastructure availability alone 
        does not guarantee digital inclusion.</p>
        <button onclick="zoomLow()">Zoom to Chad</button>
        <div class="context-layer">
          <p>High device costs, expensive mobile data, low digital literacy, and patchy electricity access create barriers 
          that limit meaningful use—even when mobile coverage technically exists.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- KEY INSIGHTS -->
      <article class="story-section" id="insights">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Coverage expands faster than actual internet use.</li>
          <li>Digital inequality is strongly linked to socio-economic disparities.</li>
          <li>A country can have strong mobile networks but low digital adoption.</li>
          <li>High connectivity correlates with greater digital opportunity.</li>
          <li>Infrastructure alone cannot close the digital divide—affordability and skills matter.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- CONCLUSION -->
      <article class="story-section" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion & Initiatives</h2>
        <p>Bridging the digital divide requires coordinated efforts across infrastructure investment, affordability, 
        policy development, and digital literacy. Understanding the spatial patterns behind digital geographies 
        helps highlight where action is most needed.</p>
